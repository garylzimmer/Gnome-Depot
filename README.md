# Magic-Shop
A magic item shop management tool designed for use in tabletop games.
Instead of actually working on my DnD campaign, I've been working on a program that would assist when players want to visit a shop and stock up on items.

Usage:

    Open ReadingXML.exe
    Click "Read XML" and point it to the XML file to populate the store with items.
    Click "Randomize Quantities" to generate randomized quantities for the store items.
