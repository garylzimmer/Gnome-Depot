For the latest binary file, click the download image above!\r\n\r\n## Program Features\r\n* Takes XML Files with a list of items that contains: type, rarity, description, price, weight, and reference.\r\n* Randomizes shop inventory based on loaded item rarities\r\n* Option to randomize pricing based on cheap, average, or expensive store price levels\r\n\r\n## How to Use?\r\n1. Make sure you downloaded an XML file from this site or the program is (mostly) useless\r\n2. Upon first opening, the program will ask for the XML file you should have downloaded.\r\n3. After that, click \"Generate Shop\" and the item quantities will fill out based on the item rarities\r\n4. Then you can start buying items!\r\n5. Once you have finished buying items, you can enter how much GP your player has in \"Starting GP\".\r\n6. Hit \"Calculate\" and it will add all the prices up and tell you how much you have left.\r\n\r\n## Additional Info\r\n### Rarity to \"Drop Rates\"\r\n* Common items will generate quantities of 5 to 10\r\n* Uncommon items will generate quantities of 0 to 5.\r\n* Rare items will generate quantities of 0 to 1.\r\n* Very Rare items will generate a quantity of 1 at 10% of the time.\r\n* Legendary items will generate a quantity of 1 at 2% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Randomized Pricing Bounds\r\n* Cheap pricing means randomizing between 50% to 100% of base price given in XML file.\r\n* Average pricing means between 75% to 125% of base price.\r\n* Expensive pricing means between 115% to 155% of base price. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\nInstead of actually working on my DnD campaign, I've been working on a program that would assist when players want to visit a shop and stock up on items. This is my first real program as I'm teaching myself C#!\r\n\r\n### Support/Contact/Ideas/Contributions?\r\nCheck out the [Github Page](https://github.com/garylzimmer/Gnome-Depot)!\r\n",
